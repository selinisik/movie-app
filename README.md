## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. This project supports `npm`or `yarn` for managing dependencies and running scripts.

### Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/selinisik/movie-app.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd movie-app
    ```

3. **Install the necessary dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
    This step ensures all required libraries and tools are installed in your local development environment.

4. **Create environment variables:**
    Create the .env file and place your OMDb API key in the env file. See .env.sample file as an example 

### Running the Development Server

    After setting up the project, start the development server with:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start    
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
